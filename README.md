# Image Processing Program in C++
This project is a C++ program designed to process images with various functionalities, allowing users to perform several transformations and enhancements on image files. The program reads images in .raw and .bmp formats, applies a series of effects and adjustments, and outputs the processed images.

## Features
The program offers the following processing options: <br/>

1-Copy - Creates a duplicate of the input image.<br/>
2-Mirror - Reflects the image along a vertical axis.<br/>
3-Invert - Flips the image vertically.<br/>
4-Negative - Converts each pixel to its negative value.<br/>
5-Brightness Adjustment - Increases or decreases the brightness of the image.<br/>
6-Thresholding - Applies a binary threshold, turning pixels above a certain value white and below it black.<br/>
7-Contrast Adjustment - Adjusts the image contrast to enhance detail.<br/>
8-Grayscale Conversion - Converts the image to grayscale by averaging RGB values.<br/>
9-Median Filtering - Applies a median filter to reduce noise.<br/>
10-Edge Detection - Highlights edges in the image using various filtering methods.<br/>
11-Overlay - Superimposes two images.<br/>
12-Histogram Generation - Creates a histogram to visualize pixel intensity distribution.<br/>
